# wb_drone_mapping
## Implement open source object-based machine learning classification of drone imagery
Python notebook for implementing extra trees classifier to drone imagery to map land cover types related to malarial mosqutio breeding sites. Code uses a range of open source libraries: rsgislib https://www.rsgislib.org/, pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html and gdal https://gdal.org/. 

Refer to rsgislib documentation for bulk installation of these very useful libraries via conda.

The code is desinged to be run with your own data, i.e. a drone image/orthoimage and a set of shapefiles representing training data samples (one per class).
